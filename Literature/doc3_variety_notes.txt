(Internal Memo, Variety Susceptibility)
Field observations on common potato varieties.

Variety Susceptibility (BC/Canada focus)

Russet Burbank — Susceptible to late blight (foliar); long dormancy, stores well; requires a uniform moisture supply to maintain tuber quality.

Kennebec — Foliage moderately resistant; tubers susceptible to late blight; excellent storage, long dormancy. Use a risk-based fungicide program; tighten spray intervals during high-pressure periods regardless of cultivar.

Yukon Gold — Susceptible to late blight (notably tuber blight); excellent storability, long dormancy; widely recognized and often marketed under its variety name.
