(Page 3, Section B: Organic Compliance)

“For a potato crop to be certified organic in Canada, growers must adhere to strict protocols.”

Finding: Organic products sold in Canada must be certified to the Canadian Organic Standards CAN/CGSB-32.310 and CAN/CGSB-32.311 under the Canada Organic Regime (CFIA). The standards set detailed compliance requirements and are the basis for certification. 

“Synthetic fungicides such as Mancozeb and Chlorothalonil are strictly prohibited.”

Finding: The standards allow only substances listed on the Permitted Substances Lists (PSL, CAN/CGSB-32.311). Any crop production aid not listed is prohibited (CAN/CGSB-32.310 §1.5(c)). Mancozeb and chlorothalonil are not on the PSL for crop production; using non-listed fungicides violates the standard. (Operators must also document any government-mandated use of a non-listed pest control substance, but that does not make the crop organic.) 

“Approved preventative measures include copper-based sprays (e.g., Copper Hydroxide) and biological agents.”

Finding: The PSL explicitly permits copper (production aid)—including copper hydroxide—for controlling pests/diseases, with restrictions (avoid soil copper buildup; no visible residues on harvested crops). The PSL also permits microorganisms and microbial products (e.g., Bacillus thuringiensis, virus sprays, spinosad) for crop protection. 

“Field history and buffer zones are also critical for organic compliance.”

Finding: Land used for organic crops must have no prohibited substances for at least 36 months before harvest (CAN/CGSB-32.310 §5.1.1). Where contamination risk exists, buffer zones are required; the standard specifies at least 8 m (or physical barriers) and that crops from buffers are not organic (CAN/CGSB-32.310 §5.2.1–5.2.2).
